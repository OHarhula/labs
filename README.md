# labs
These are my labs. There are many of them, but these are mine. My labs are my best friends. There are my life. I have to learn to own Java as I own my own life. My labs are useless without me. I am useless without my labs. I have to write good code in Java. I have to write better code than a fellow student trying to get a scholarship. I have to get it before he gets it. And I will do it. I swear to god. Me and my labs - we are the protectors of my financial well-being. We are not afraid of difficulties. We are the saviors of life. So be it. Until there are no more tasks left and peace comes. Amen.
